# AlphaLexChinese

AlphaLexChinese, a tool that measures lexical complexity in Chinese texts.

- AlphaLexChinese (ALC) measures lexical complexity in Chinese texts.

- ALC uses 50 metrics across three dimensions: density, sophistication, and variation.

- Nine ALC metrics significantly predict L2 Chinese writing scores.

- Sophistication and variation metrics are key predictors of writing quality.

- ALC has implications for language assessment, materials development, and AES.

Please refer to our article for a detailed description of the tool.
